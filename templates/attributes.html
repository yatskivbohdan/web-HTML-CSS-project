<h1>HTML Attributes</h1>
    <p>Attributes define additional characteristics or properties of the element such as width and height of an image. Attributes are always specified in the start tag (or opening tag) and usually consists of name/value pairs like <code>name="value"</code>. Attribute values should always be enclosed in quotation marks.</p>
    <p>Also, some attributes are required for certain elements. For instance, an <code>&ltimg&gt</code> tag must contain a src and alt attributes. Let's take a look at some examples of the attributes usages:</p>
    <img src="{% static 'media/att1.png'%}" alt="example1">
    <p>In the above example <code>src</code> inside the <code>&ltimg&gt</code>tag is an attribute and image path provided is its value. Similarly <code>href</code> inside the <code>&lta&gt</code> tag is an attribute and the link provided is its value, and so on.</p>
    <p>There are several attributes in HTML5 that do not consist of name/value pairs but consists of just name. Such attributes are called Boolean attributes. Examples of some commonly used Boolean attributes are <code>checked, disabled, readonly, required</code>, etc.</p>
    <img src="{% static 'media/att2.png'%}" alt="example2">

    <h2>General Purpose Attributes</h2>
        <p>There are some attributes, such as <code>id, title, class, style</code>, etc. that you can use on the majority of HTML elements. The following section describes their usages.</p>
        <h3>The id Attribute</h3>
            <p>The <code>id</code> attribute is used to give a unique name or identifier to an element within a document. This makes it easier to select the element using CSS or JavaScript.</p>
            <img src="{% static 'media/att3.png'%}" alt="example3">
        <h3>The class Attribute</h3>
            <p>Like <code>id</code> attribute, the <code>class</code> attribute is also used to identify elements. But unlike id, the <code>class</code> attribute does not have to be unique in the document. This means you can apply the same class to multiple elements in a document, as shown in the following example:</p>
            <img src="{% static 'media/att4.png'%}" alt="example4">
        <h3>The title Attribute</h3>
            <p>The <code>title</code> attribute to is used to provide advisory text about an element or its content. Try out the following example to understand how this actually works.</p>
            <img src="{% static 'media/att5.png'%}" alt="example5">
        <h3>The style Attribute</h3>
            <p>The <code>style</code> attribute allows you to specify CSS styling rules such as color, font, border, etc. directly within the element. Let's check out an example to see how it works:</p>
            <img src="{% static 'media/att6.png'%}" alt="example6">
